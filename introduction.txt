Of course! Let's modify the script based on your feedback.

**Opening Line:** 
"Hello everyone! Today, I'll show you a fascinating tool we've developed. It captures PostgreSQL instance data from all our OCP clusters, letting us double-check our configurations and understand our usage."

---

**Introducing the Web Tool:** 
"This tool is our PostgreSQL compass. It lays out where our databases are, how they're structured, and what they cost us. Essentially, it's our birds-eye view on everything PostgreSQL-related."

---

**Colors Tell a Story:**
"Notice the colors on the screen? They're not just for decoration. They give us quick insights. For instance:
- If you see a specific color, it might mean that a database is in the 'us-west-2' region when it shouldn't be.
- Another color might hint that multiAZ is enabled where it isn't needed.
- And if you spot another hue, it could be signaling that a pre-prod environment is using a larger database than necessary."

---

**Using the Filter:** 
"And over there, is our special search bar. It's like our microscope. Want details about a specific region or environment? Just type it in and zero in on the specifics."

---

**Digging Into Details:** 
"Every box, every color, every word here is a piece of our PostgreSQL puzzle:
- What size is that database? Is it a giant or a tiny one?
- Which corner of our world is it in? East or West?
- And is it enjoying a backup? Like, has it got multiAZ switched on?"

---

**How We Save:** 
"Imagine your wallet with tiny holes. That's our setup without this tool. Money keeps slipping away. But now, with this tool, we're spotting those holes and plugging them up."

---

**The Bigger Picture:** 
"It's not just about pennies and dollars. It's about efficiency. It's about ensuring we're getting the best out of our resources. This tool? It's our guide to that."

---

**Ending:** 
"I'm really thrilled about this. It's not just a tool; it's our strategy, our way forward. Thank you for tuning in. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and questions."

This should add more depth to your presentation and address the specific points you mentioned.
